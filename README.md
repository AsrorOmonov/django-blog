# django-blog

This is a simple blog app completed with Django web framework. Mostly focused on backend compared to frontend. The user or admin can use CRUD. Besides, registration system is also available. That means a user can sign up, log in, log out etc.


After cloning the project, you can install every package manually:
  1) pip install venv
  2) pip install -r requirements.txt
  3) python manage.py runserver

Yet, to ease your job, docker container is used. Once you run docker image, the projects start working on localhost:8000.
You can use admin panel of Django to post. By the way, do not forget to create superuser on your local machine.

python manage.py createsuperuser

Last step:
  - python manage.py runserver
