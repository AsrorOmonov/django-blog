# django-blog

This is a simple blog app completed with Django web framework. Mostly focused on backend compared to frontend. The user or admin can use CRUD. Besides, registration system is also available.


After cloning the project, you can install every package manually:
  1) Install venv
  2) pip install -r requirements.txt
  3) python manage.py runserver

Yet, to ease your job, docker container is used. Once you run docker image, the projects start working on localhost:8000.
You can use admin panel of Django to post. By the way, do not forget to create superuser on your local machine.

python manage.py createsuperuser

Last step:
  - python manage.py runserver
